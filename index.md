## What are "alternative" MEGA65 cores?

From day one, the MEGA65 was designed to be the spiritual successor of the legendary Commodore 65 on the planet.
But the MEGA65 is much more than "just" that. It is also a MEGA versatile FPGA-based machine, a **chameleon**, that can turn itself into
any other machine you can imagine. All you need to peform this feat is a "alternative" MEGA65 core.

## Can I add a core to this list?

Please message me on Discord (`sy2002#5425`), write me an email to `code` at `sy2002` dot `de`,
create an [Issue](https://github.com/sy2002/m65cores/issues) or create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/sy2002/m65cores/pulls),
if you think this list is incomplete and/or want me to add your project (work-in-progress projects are welcome!).

## How do I install an alternative MEGA65 core?

1. Copy the `.cor` file on an SD card and insert it into the MEGA65
2. Make sure your MEGA65 is turned off
3. Press and hold the <kbd>NO SCROLL</kbd> key in the top row at position 5
4. Turn on your MEGA65
5. Press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd> (or another number) to select the slot where you'd like to install the alternate core.
   You do not need to worry: You can change the slot at a later stage and you cannot overwrite your factory MEGA65 core and brick your machine.
6. Select the `.cor` file on your SD card

[Download the MEGA65 starter guide](https://files.mega65.org/news/MEGA65-Starter-Guide.pdf) and read the section `Bitstream Utility` to learn more.

## How do I run an alternative MEGA65 core?
