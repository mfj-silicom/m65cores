## What are "alternative" MEGA65 cores?

From day one, the MEGA65 was designed to be the spiritual successor of the legendary Commodore 65 on the planet.
But the MEGA65 is much more than "just" that. It is also a MEGA versatile FPGA-based machine, a chameleon, that can turn itself into
any other machine you can imagine. All you need to peform this feat is a "alternative" MEGA65 core.

## How do I install an alternative MEGA65 core?

1. Copy the .cor file on an SD card and insert it into the MEGA65
2. Make sure your MEGA65 is turned off
3. Press and hold the <kbd>NO SCROLL<kbd> key in the most top row at position 5
4. Turn on your MEGA65
5.
